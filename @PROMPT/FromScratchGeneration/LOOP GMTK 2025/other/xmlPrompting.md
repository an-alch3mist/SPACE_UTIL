	The thread is divided, but the general consensus is that structured prompting is a game-changer, though the reason why is up for debate.
	
	The top-voted take is that using XML simply forces you to organize your thoughts better, and that's what leads to better results. Many users agree, reporting they get the same boost from using Markdown or just well-organized paragraphs.
	
	However, several users shut down the skeptics by linking to Anthropic's official documentation, which explicitly recommends using XML tags to help Claude parse complex prompts. A few others noted that different Anthropic docs suggest this is becoming less necessary as models improve, with some calling it a waste of tokens.
	
	The final verdict? While Anthropic does endorse XML, the community largely agrees that any clear, consistent structure is better than a wall of text. Whether you use XML, Markdown, or just good formatting, the key is helping Claude (and yourself) break down the request.
