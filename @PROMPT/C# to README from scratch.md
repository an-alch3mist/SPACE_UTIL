given a script below, what is the minimum documentation you could produce so that i could use it as markdown documentation prompt to produce future script, without providing entire `*.cs` instead i just provide `*.cs.md`
btw the pasted prompt is what i comeup with, the main goal is for the prompt and other files that are being generated know what this file containe,
say: namespace, inheritance being used , and depency classes that it refer to and all public class, static class and their public API(void, return type, IEnumerator that are public), and also public enum and public interface(and all its field since all its function are non public) and public events(System events or Unity events etc) as well as unity life cycle(regadless private such as Awake(), Update(), Start(), Update(), OnMouseEnter(), OnCollisionEnter() etc),
also could you also include a checksum at end in a word say `2020-sept-20 v0.8.5` and the `*.cs.md` that is generated by this prompt also include that check sum at end

what you think, and could you provide the improvised/rewrite/critique prompt make sure there might be many namespace, i just want the improvised prompt that provide detailed short documentation of everything required(use the pasted as reference it should work on everything including the ComplexSample.cs).

 i just want the improvised prompt in a file. while keeping the (output `*.cs.md` when i get from running this prompt for any (`*.cs`) does not exceed 7,000 chars and could be even less if possible maybe ~4,000 etc if less public API)




 i did try to generate *.cs.md from this prompt, i see many method in GameManager class such as AddPlayer Remove Player etc arent included in the table, include those since they are publicly exposed and maybe useful in other script, also dont you think its better to refer to a certain non root class(meaning of non root class: class that is not high level in the namespace or class that are nested inside root class(class that are high in a certain namespace are called root class) note that there could be multiple namespaces with multiple root classes amd multiple nestedclass(if public) and same goes for enum, Interface, event, void, return, returnType, fields, IEnumerator that are public, i understand this shall increase the chas in *.cs.min.md that is generated think feel free to think and organize in such a way its not too wordy, say for example if a certain nested B class is in root class A which is incide namepace N.Core than menthin that this nested class is refered as N.Core.A.B and than provide all its public method/fields (if any))  btw an interface is provided same way(also in interface it doesnt matter its method inside are public or not, provide everthing within interface and say interface I inside root class A which is inside namespace N.Interfaces than the interface is first let know as N.Interfaces.A.I ), so make it less wordy just mention how a certain Interface/class is refered say N.Interfaces.A.I than provide its method so that way not much wordy.
